# ETL_Project

1) Extract ASIN numbers from 21stCenturyBooks.csv and use them to create unique query urls to scrape Amazon.com for the following:
    - Book Title
    - Amazon's Price
    - List Price
    - Product Details

2) Save the scraped data as Amazon_Book_Data.csv.

3) Build the MySQL schema 21CenturyBookData and import Amazon_Book_Data.csv and Lerner_Product_internal.csv into it.

4) The primary purpose of this schema is to compare Amazon's price with Lerner Publishing's list price.
