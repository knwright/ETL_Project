    Our project was born out of a real-world scenario from Erin's employer. Erin works for a book publisher that sells books online. There has been a desire at her company to get a better idea of how her company's products are being sold online, how they are presented and what they are being sold for. With that information, the company can ensure that their product pages online have accuracte information, and analyze the profit margins the retailer is making.
    To gather that information, we needed to use a list of her company's books provided by the company. This list was saved as a CSV, and it included each book's title, ISBN, release date, and other unique identifier numbers. <<<how was this data cleaned up>>> In order to load up each book's product information page, we needed to build a url to connect to each page. We were able to find a search by ISBN query (AISN and ISBN numbers are equal) which redirected to the product details page. We then used BeautifulSoup to scrape each book's desired details (<<<list all parameters>>>).
